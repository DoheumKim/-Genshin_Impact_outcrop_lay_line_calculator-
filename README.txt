This is a program I created to tell you how many times you need to go around a ley line when collecting mora or collecting experience books in the game "Genshin Impact".
Some terms may be unfamiliar to those unfamiliar with Genshin Impact.

Currently only available in Korean. An English version will be available soon.
I welcome your feedback.
